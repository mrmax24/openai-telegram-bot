## Project structure

#### <u>API</u>
The Admin panel part has a Three-Tier Architecture:
- **Presentation layer** (Controller) - accepts requests from clients and sends results back to them.
- **Application logic** layer (Service) - provide logic to operate on the data sent to and from the Repository and the client.
- **Data access layer** (Repository) - represents a bridge between the database and the application.

Telegram bot part:
- **Telegram bot logic** - contains logic enabling data exchange between the bot and the interface, 
with integrated functionality for interacting with ChatGPT.

#### <u>FRONTEND</u>
- **Components** - contains the HTML and CSS defining a specific page or UI element, along with TypeScript code 
that handles the logic, user interactions, and communication with the backend in an Angular application.
- **Services** - manage the communication with the backend, encapsulating data retrieval, business logic, and interactions between components.
- **Modules** - organize the Angular application into cohesive blocks, facilitating modularity, encapsulation, and maintainability.
- **Assets** - contains static assets like images or fonts used in the application.

## Steps to run the program on your computer:
1. Clone the repo: https://github.com/mrmax24/openai-telegram-bot;
2. Install PostgreSQL;
3. Create new schema in database;
4. Add you DB properties to **application.properties** file;
5. Create connection to DB using Database option (Intellij Idea Ultimate);
6. Install Angular CLI in **/frontend** using command `npm install -g @angular/cli`;
7. Run Angular using command `ng serve`;
8. Done. Now just run Spring and navigate to http://localhost:4200;
